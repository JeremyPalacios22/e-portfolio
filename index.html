        <p>
          Upon reviewing my APQ and S2S Academy assessment results, I have gained significant insights into my skills and characteristics that are pertinent to the field of software development. The APQ assessment underscored my strong problem-solving abilities and logical reasoning, which are vital for debugging and developing efficient algorithms. Additionally, it highlighted my adaptability and resilience, qualities that are essential when acquiring new technologies or addressing intricate coding challenges.
          Conversely, my PCK results indicated strengths in analytical thinking and meticulous attention to detail, both of which are fundamental to successful software development. Furthermore, these results showcased my collaborative spirit and effective communication skills, which are crucial for teamwork, conducting code reviews, and translating technical requirements into practical software solutions.

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        Going through SAS3000 was an eye-opening experience. I learned how to navigate interviews and realized that while I know what I want to say, I often struggle with stuttering and taking time to organize my thoughts into clear sentences. This helped me recognize the importance of pacing myself in conversations. The modules also exposed me to various opportunities available in my field, and I discovered the need to be more proactive in my academics. As a software development student, I now understand the importance of starting personal projects to further develop my skills and take more initiative in shaping my career.
        <br>
        <br>
        My past and present experiences have shaped how I approach my career pursuits by highlighting areas I need to work on to become a more well-rounded individual. These experiences have created certain biases, fears, and bad habits that sometimes hold me back, but they have also been valuable lessons that have helped me grow and improve. While I recognize the challenges these influences can bring, I also see how they’ve made me more self-aware and resilient. This growth makes me optimistic and enthusiastic about working hard to achieve my career goals and continuously better myself along the way.
        <br>
        <br>
        I want to improve my time management skills, as they’ve been a major obstacle in balancing my responsibilities and personal interests. I also want to break bad habits like doom scrolling, which take up too much of my time and leave me feeling unproductive. Recently, I’ve been feeling burnt out from constantly being on a screen—whether coding, watching videos, or gaming. To counter this, I want to rediscover hobbies I’ve neglected, like reading, exercising, and playing the saxophone, all of which I’ve stopped due to poor time management. Making these changes will help me feel more balanced and fulfilled.
        <br>
        <br>
        The way I choose to act has significant implications for my career, personal growth, and the people around me. If I take proactive steps to improve my skills, manage my time better, and maintain a healthy balance, I can create more opportunities for success and growth in my career. Conversely, neglecting these areas could lead to missed opportunities, burnout, and unfulfilled potential. My actions also affect others, as my ability to contribute effectively and maintain positive relationships impacts teamwork and collaboration. Ultimately, staying mindful of my choices helps me build a strong foundation for both my professional and personal life.
